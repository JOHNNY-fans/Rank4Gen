Atta and al-Shehhi attended Huffman Aviation to learn to fly small aircraft, meeting Dekkers in July 2000. The school filed M-1 student visa request forms for them in August 2000 to allow enrollment in a professional pilot program. Following the attacks, the FBI investigated Huffman Aviation, seizing records that showed Atta and al-Shehhi paid $10,000 for two months of flight instruction. Dekkers cooperated with the FBI, providing records and stating that he saw no red flags. After the attacks, Dekkers experienced bankruptcy, lost his business and house, divorced, and received death threats. He also faced issues with the Internal Revenue Service, lenders, and the Federal Aviation Administration. In March 2002, Huffman Aviation was cited for safety concerns, including unlocked fuel trucks with keys in the ignition. Dekkers sold Huffman Aviation in 2003. He stated in 2011 that Atta and al-Shehhi never displayed behaviors indicative of terrorists, though Atta was described as a \"dead man walking\" due to his demeanor. Dekkers maintained his innocence, stating he could not have done anything about the attacks and that he lived with the impact of 9/11 daily.","is_supporting":true,"id":"2"},{"title":"Rick

He felt the radio needed fresh material and conceived the song mentally in approximately fifteen minutes, noting its memorability upon his arrival at campus. Martin shared the song with his bandmates, and they performed a portion of it alongside Boyz II Men songs at the talent show. They refined the harmonies and presented the complete song at an open-mic night, receiving a positive audience response. A demo was created and presented to the Howard radio station, WHUR, but it was not played. Undeterred, Martin approached DJ Paco Lopez of the local station WPGC at a charity softball game in August and sang the song for him. Lopez received the demo and played it the following day for a group of women at the station, who reacted enthusiastically, convincing the program director of the song's potential hit status. WPGC, a leading station in Washington, DC, began playing the demo, generating significant listener response. Shai subsequently signed with Gasoline Alley, which released the song in October.
