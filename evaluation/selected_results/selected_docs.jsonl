Atta and al-Shehhi attended Huffman Aviation to learn to fly small aircraft, meeting Dekkers in July 2000. The school filed M-1 student visa request forms for them in August 2000 to allow enrollment in a professional pilot program. Following the attacks, the FBI investigated Huffman Aviation, seizing records that showed Atta and al-Shehhi paid $10,000 for two months of flight instruction. Dekkers cooperated with the FBI, providing records and stating that he saw no red flags. After the attacks, Dekkers experienced bankruptcy, lost his business and house, divorced, and received death threats. He also faced issues with the Internal Revenue Service, lenders, and the Federal Aviation Administration. In March 2002, Huffman Aviation was cited for safety concerns, including unlocked fuel trucks with keys in the ignition. Dekkers sold Huffman Aviation in 2003. He stated in 2011 that Atta and al-Shehhi never displayed behaviors indicative of terrorists, though Atta was described as a \"dead man walking\" due to his demeanor. Dekkers maintained his innocence, stating he could not have done anything about the attacks and that he lived with the impact of 9/11 daily."}], "std_answer": "July 27, 1956.", "answer": ""}
